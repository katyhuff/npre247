To accommodate many learning types, I'll assess many types of activities. Your comprehension of the readings will be assessed with quizzes, your ability to apply what you've learned from class on your own will be assessed with the homeworks and projects, and your wholistic retention of the material will be assessed with exams.\n",

    "\n",
    "Rather than spending time in class to introduce concepts for the first time, I think our time is better spent if we focus on exploring those concepts through demonstration and discussion together. **This 'active learning' educational strategy is backed by science, but is also just more respectful of your ability to learn things on your own.** Therefore, the lectures will assume you have studied the background materials ahead of time. This will include book sections, government reports, videos, and other resources. You will be expected to study the material outside of class before the start of each week. I recommend you take notes on this material as any of it may be assessed in the exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Monday of each week I'll assign a list of material. You'll have 7 days to study that material before we start covering those concepts in class.**\n",

    "To help me calibrate the in-class discussion, a weekly quiz will assess your comprehension of the background material. The quizzes can be taken online through [Compass2g](https://compass2g.illinois.edu) at any time during the week, but they must be completed by Monday at 10am, 7 days after the material was assigned.\n",

    "Homeworks will be assigned each Friday concerning the material covered that week. You will have 7 days to do the homework, so it will be due at 10am on the following Friday. It will need to be turned in via compass as a PDF. If you don't\n",

    "1. To create a GitHub account\n",
    "2. To enroll in the class on the github classroom site\n",

Everything she says about her math classes is true for this class as well. You should expect to spend 3 hours outside of class for every hour you spend in class. So, for a 3 credit class, you'll need to spend 3 hours a week in class and 9 hours outside of class on the coursework. If you find you're spending much less or much more time on this class, please let me know. \n",

Please note that such a letter is appropriate for many types of conflicts, but that religious conflicts require special early handling. In accordance with university policy, students seeking an excused absence for religious reasons should complete the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances Form, which can be found on the Office of the Dean of Students website. The student should submit this form to the instructor and the Office of the Dean of Students by the end of the second week of the course to which it applies."

Sometimes, I will call them by their old name, \"IPython notebooks,\" but I'm talking about \"Jupyter notebooks\". Interleaved with the course notes, we will often write small functions in the Python programming language to represent the equations we are talking about.

Programming is really hard without the internet. \n",

Those computers are servers at GitHub, a sometimes silly but also very important company in the beautiful city of San Francisco. GitHub stores \"git repositories\" which are collections of files that are \"version controlled\" by the program \"git.\" This is a lot to keep track of, and I won't require that you learn git to participate in this class. However, I strongly recommend using git and GitHub and to keep track of your research code. So, I encourage you to use git to access the notebooks. \n",
