    "> Most isotopes of an element are radioactive, i.e., their nuclei are unstable. To better understand what makes a nucleus stable, it is instructive to plot the BE per nucleon, BE/A, of all the isotopes of an element. For example, if one calculates the BE/A for all the isotopes of calcium (Z = 20), as is done in Example 4.2 for one isotope, and plots BE/A versus the neutron number N, a plot like that shown in Fig. 4.2 is obtained. The BE/A rapidly rises as N increase from A = 14 and reaches a broad maximum before rapidly decreasing as N increases above 30. It is in the broad maximum where the BE/A is highest that one finds the stable isotopes. The reason for the zig-zag shape in the maximum region is due to the fact that an isotope with an even number of neutrons tends to have a higher BE/A compared\n",

During this process, an orbital electron is usually also lost from the resulting product atom.  Thus, we must include an extra electron in the equation. \n",
