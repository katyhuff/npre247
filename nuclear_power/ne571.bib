	abstract = {A combination of transient heat transfer analytical solutions for a finite line source, a 
series of point sources, and a series of parallel infinite line sources were combined with 
a quasi-steady-state multi-layered cylindrical solution to simulate the temperature 
response of a deep geologic radioactive waste repository with multi-layered natural and 
engineered barriers.  
This evaluation was performed to provide information to scientists and decision makers 
to compare candidate geologic media for a repository (crystalline rock [granite], clay, 
salt, and deep borehole), and to provide input for the future evaluation of the trade-off 
between pre-emplacement surface storage time, waste package size, and repository 
footprint.
This approach was selected in favor of the finite element solution typically used to 
analyze the temperature response because it allowed rapid comparison of a large 
number of alternative disposal options and design configurations.  More than 100
combinations of waste form, geologic environment, repository design configuration, and 
surface storage times were analyzed and compared.},

	abstract = {High level waste (HLW) management requires being able to demonstrate the safety over geological timescales, typically 1 My. This can be made possible by using a rigorous, complex and iterative scientific approach called Long-term Behavior Science. The methodology relies on experiments and modelling. A large multi-scale approach is required and involves a mechanistic understanding of the key phenomena controlling the source term (i.e. the flux of radionuclides released from the waste as a function of time), as well as parametric studies, integrated and in situ tests. As a result, it is eventually possible to develop an operational model based on clever simplifications of a very complex reality, ensuring that predictions will always remain conservative despite conceptual and numerical uncertainties. Finally, predictive models must be validated based on the study of natural or archaeological analogues. In this paper, we show how this methodology can be applied by selecting examples of spent nuclear fuel and HLW glass.},

	abstract = {The present report describes the plan to produce Posiva Oy{\textquoteright}s safety case in support of the operating licence application for a facility for the geological disposal of radioactive waste at the Olkiluoto site. In the present context, a safety case is a synthesis of evidence, analyses and arguments that quantify and substantiate the level of expert confidence in the long-term safety of the facility. The plan is based on the lessons learned from the previous safety case (TURVA-2012) supporting the construction licence application, feedback from the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK), present regulations and regulatory guides and international guidance on post-closure safety assessment.

The disposal facility includes a spent nuclear fuel (SNF) repository and a repository for the disposal of low and intermediate level waste (LILW) from the operation and decommissioning of the encapsulation plant. The SNF repository design used in the present safety case is KBS-3V, in which the SNF canisters are emplaced in vertical deposition holes surrounded by bentonite buffer. The LILW repository, located at intermediate depth, is based on a system of engineered barriers (concrete and crushed rock) plus the natural barrier (host rock). 

The safety case consists of a portfolio of eight main reports, complemented by a number of supporting reports. The main reports in the portfolio are: Design Basis, Initial State, Low and Intermediate Level Waste Repository Assessment (LILW-RA), Performance Assessment and Formulation of Scenarios (PAFOS), Analysis of Releases, Models and Data, Complementary Considerations and Synthesis. The inclusion of the LILW-RA report in the safety case portfolio reflects the aim of integrating both the LILW repository and the SNF repository within the safety case, in accordance with the feedback from STUK. The surface environment is part of the disposal system and its assessment is also integrated in the overall safety case, and accordingly included in the scope of the PAFOS, Analysis of Releases and Models and Data reports. The Analysis of Releases report will contain the analysis of radionuclide release scenarios derived from PAFOS and LILW-RA and an assessment of their radiological consequences. The Synthesis report brings together all lines of argument in support of Posiva{\textquoteright}s understanding of the evolution of the disposal system and long-term safety, evaluation of compliance with the regulatory requirements, and presents an overall statement of confidence in the long-term safety of geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto site.

The focus of the present plan is on the overall safety case methodology, the safety case portfolio structure, its most important features and main supporting activities, such as the formulation of scenarios and uncertainty assessment. The report also presents quality management in the safety case work.},
